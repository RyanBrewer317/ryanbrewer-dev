There is additionally a condition that must be satisfied called &quot;functoriality,&quot; which is that composition and identities are preserved: \(F(g\circ f)=Fg\circ Ff\), and \(F(id_X)=id_{FX}\). This leads some to call functors a &quot;homomorphism of categories,&quot; if you&#39;re familiar with abstract algebra.<br></span></div><div><span>(Category theory doesn&#39;t do parentheses for applying mappings to things; \(Fg\) might be written \(F(g)\) in what you&#39;re used to.)<br></span></div><div><span>So if I have some diagram in my category \(C\) then a functor \(F:C\to D\) gives me a diagram in \(D\) that can be drawn in a very similar way: <br></span></div><div class="diagram"><img src="/image-0-functor.svg" onload="this.width *= 2.25;"></div><div><span>This does *not* mean that if \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) are different from each other, then \(FX\), \(FY\), and \(FZ\) are too. It *only* means that, assuming the first diagram commutes, the second one does too. \(FX\) could be equal to \(FY\), and \(Fp\) could even just be \(id_{FX}\)! So long as commuting diagrams are mapped to diagrams that also commute. One example of a functor that I like is from the monoid-based category of addition on natural numbers to the monoid-based category of multiplication on natural numbers. The single monoid object gets mapped into the other single monoid object, of course. There are a bunch of functors to choose from here, but I like powers of 2 so I&#39;ll map every morphism \(n\) in the addition category to the morphism \(2^n\) in the multiplication category. That&#39;s a functor because if I compose two morphisms in the addition category (say, \(2+3\)) then does the right thing in the multiplication category. Functors are often written with a dash in the place of the parameter, so this functor would be written \(2^-\). Here&#39;s a diagram to help illustrate:<br></span></div><div class="diagram"><img src="/image-0-functor.svg" onload="this.width *= 2.25;"></div><div><span>This represents how exponentiation turns multiplication into addition! Composition in these categories are addition and multiplication respectively, and the functor is raising 2 to a power, so the functors-preserve-composition equation \(F(g\circ f)=Fg\circ Ff\) becomes \(2^{n+m}=2^ncdot 2^m\), a rule for exponentials we learn in high school!<br></span></div><div><span>I find it helpful to remember that functors are just arrows in \(\texttt{Cat}\). They&#39;re just transformations from collections of objects and morphisms to other collections of objects and morphisms, and we&#39;ve attached a restriction to them that we&#39;ve found useful and commonly-satisfied. A category of all small categories could be created where the arrows aren&#39;t functors, and functors aren&#39;t some new axiomatic thing in category theory. It&#39;s still all just objects and arrows, and functors are just an example of morphisms. They just feel different when we use them because we&#39;re not working in \(\texttt{Cat}\) but *within some object* in \(\texttt{Cat}\), so the arrows of \(\texttt{Cat}\) have a sort of strange (but useful!) effect.<br></span></div><div><span>In programming we often deal with categories of collections. So an object (say, a set) contains elements within it. It&#39;s very important to keep in mind that functors just map objects to objects and can&#39;t touch the elements within at all. A functor might map the set \(\{4\}\) to the empty set \(\{\}\), and note that there isn&#39;t any function from \(\{4\}\) to the empty set, since there&#39;s no way to transform \(4\) into nothing! The real function is on the collections of objects (and morphisms), of which \(\{4\}\) and \(\{\}\) are just regular old members. This fact makes functors useful in programming. An &quot;endofunctor&quot; is a looping morphism in \(\texttt{Cat}\), so it goes from a category back to the same category. A popular example in programming is the List functor, which maps any type `T` into the type of lists whose elements are of type `T`, called something like `List&lt;T&gt;`. Again, `T` could be `void` and this mapping is still perfectly fine, because we&#39;re just transforming types, not the values of those types. `List&lt;void&gt;` is a perfectly valid type and has exactly one value, namely `[]`. The List functor maps morphisms (functions) \(f:T\to U\) to \(\texttt{map}\;f:\texttt{List}\;T\to\texttt{List}\;U\), functions which apply \(f\) to each element in the list to produce a new list. That&#39;s something we do a lot in functional programming and I think that&#39;s awesome!<br></span></div><div><span>For any two categories \(C\) and \(D\) in \(\texttt{Cat}\), the collection of morphisms between them forms a category called a &quot;[/wiki/functor-category](functor category),&quot; written \([C,D]\). This being an object in \(\texttt{Cat}\) itself, it&#39;s an [/wiki/exponential-object](exponential object). The morphisms in a functor category are called [/wiki/natural-transformation](natural transformations).<br></span></div></div><div><div style="height:100pt;"></div><p id="copyright-notice" class="subtle-text">© 2024 Ryan Brewer.</p><script src="/__/firebase/8.10.1/firebase-app.js"></script><script src="/__/firebase/8.10.1/firebase-analytics.js"></script><script src="/__/firebase/init.js"></script><script>firebase.analytics();</script></div></body></html>
