Consider the python program below:<br></span></div><pre><code># this is equivalent to print(input() + 4) 
# but the variables make it easier to talk about
x = input()
y = 2 + 2 # always evaluates to 4
z = y + x # depends on user input
print(z)
</code></pre><div><span>When a program is run, it has some set of inputs that change how the program progresses to completion.<br>In this case, it&#39;s the value assigned to `x`.<br>For a given run of the program, it only has one concrete input, and only unfolds in one way.<br>If you enter `3`, the program calculates and prints `7`.<br>But there are other ways it *could* have gone, if the original input were different.<br>It wouldn&#39;t have printed `7` if the input were, say, `5`.<br>And there are some parts of each run of the program that are the same no matter what the inputs are,<br>like the value of `y`.<br>Framed in modal logic, we&#39;ll say that `z` is *possibly* `7`, and `y` is *necessarily* `4`.<br>*That&#39;s* the understanding of possibility and necessity we&#39;ll use for this post.<br>A vocabulary for talking about different runs of a given program.<br>Regular propositions are for the &quot;current run,&quot; <br>necessary ones are true in all runs,<br>and possible ones are true in some runs, which could be the current one but might not be.<br></span></div><div><span>In logic, &quot;\(P\) is possible&quot; is written \(\Diamond P\)<br>and &quot;\(P\) is necessary&quot; is written \(\Box P\).<br></span></div><div><span>First of all, it&#39;s worth taking a moment to appreciate the beauty of modal logic.<br>Possibility and necessity are dual in the same way conjunction and disjunction are,<br>or universal and existential quantification are. <br>That is, take some proposition \(P\). <br>\(\neg (\Diamond (\neg P))\), or &quot;it is not possible that \(P\) is false,&quot;<br>is equivalent to \(\Box P\), or &quot;\(P\) is necessary.&quot;<br>\(\neg (\Box (\neg P))\), or &quot;it is not necessary that \(P\) is false,&quot;<br>is equivalent to \(\Diamond P\), or &quot;\(P\) is possible.&quot;<br>That is, negating the inputs and outputs of one gets you the other, <br>just like conjunction/disjunction and just like existential/universal quantification.<br></span></div><div><span>They&#39;re also dual in a sort of category-theory way:<br>possibility is a monad and necessity is a comonad.<br>Showing why is a nice demonstration of the modalities,<br>so here it is: for any proposition \(P\), <br></span></div><div><div class="math-block">\[P\implies\Diamond P\]</div><div class="math-block">\[\Diamond (\Diamond P)\implies\Diamond P\]</div><div class="math-block">\[\Box P\implies P\]</div><div class="math-block">\[\Box P\implies\Box (\Box P)\]</div><div class="math-block">\[\]</div></div><div><span>You can see in these rules the monadic &quot;return&quot; and &quot;join&quot; operations<br>and comonadic &quot;extract&quot; and &quot;duplicate&quot; operations.<br>It&#39;s also worth going through them and intuitively checking if they make sense.<br></span></div><h3><span>Security<br></span></h3><div><span>If you&#39;re familiar with language-based security theory,<br>you might immediately see a use for this.<br>LBS is largely built around a concept called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interference_(security)](noninterference),<br>the property that secret inputs don&#39;t interfere with less-secret outputs.<br>It&#39;s a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperproperty](hyperproperty),<br>meaning that it&#39;s talking about all possible runs of the program<br>instead of just a few particular ones.<br>Sound familiar?<br>In our modal vocabulary we might say that public outputs are<br>*necessary* with respect to secret inputs;<br>they aren&#39;t affected in any run of the program by those inputs.<br></span></div><div><span>This is a little bit different from how LBS is usually studied.<br>To oversimplify, there&#39;s usually a `Secret` monad that<br>ensures the values it holds can only affect other `Secret` values.<br>In the modal language, however, we&#39;re talking about a <br>`Public` comonad that makes sure the held value only depends on `Public` values. <br>This flipping of perspective has been studied a bit,<br>most notably by [https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3563335](Choudhury).<br>He takes inspiration from a system by [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3011069](Davies) (that is<br>explicitly inspired by necessity in modal logic) that is used to <br>determine which expressions in a language don&#39;t depend on user input,<br>and can therefore be evaluated at compiletime as an optimization.<br>This is like noticing that `y` is necessarily `4` in the python code above,<br>and removing the addition.<br>Choudhury extends this idea for language-based security, <br>combining it with the `Secret` monad I just mentioned.<br></span></div><h3><span>Crashing<br></span></h3><div><span>Consider for a moment what it is that an [https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp](assert statement) <br>does in a program.
