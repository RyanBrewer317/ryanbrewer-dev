That is, those morphisms are objects in some category, so there may be morphisms <i><span>between the morphisms!</span></i>
</span></p><p><span>We often include some notion of &quot;nontriviality&quot; (&quot;interesting-ness&quot;), because <i><span>any</span></i> set forms a category: the objects are the elements and the morphisms are strict equality. This is called a &quot;discrete&quot; category because there are no morphisms between objects, and indeed it&#39;s a fairly trivial (aka boring) category because the only arrows are identity arrows. So when we say that something is a 2-category we generally mean that the category formed by the elements of \(C(A,B)\) is a bit more interesting (aka nontrivial) in some way.
</span></p><p><span>Morphisms between morphisms in a 2-category are called 2-cells, regular morphisms are called 1-cells, and the objects are called 0-cells. 2-cells are often drawn like this:
</span></p><div class="diagram"><img src="/image-0-2-category.svg" onload="this.width *= 2.25;"></div><p><span>I often find that notation confusing, though, because it makes it seem like we just added some new construct to category theory, the arrows-between-arrows. In reality, it&#39;s just that there are two different categories, and one has some morphisms, and the other has those morphisms as objects. So there&#39;s nothing fundamentally new going on here.
</span></p><p><span>Notice that 2-cells <i><span>don&#39;t</span></i> go across homsets. That is to say, they <i><span>cannot</span></i> do this:
</span></p><div class="diagram"><img src="/image-1-2-category.svg" onload="this.width *= 2.25;"></div><p><span>This is <i><span>not</span></i> a valid 2-cell! It crosses from \(C(X,Y)\) to \(C(Z,W)\), instead of staying in one or the other. 2-cells are <i><span>only</span></i> stuck within the same homset.
</span></p><p><span>The most famous 2-category is <a href="/wiki/cat"><span>\(\texttt{Cat}\)</span></a>, the category of <a href="/wiki/large-and-small-categories"><span>small categories</span></a>. The objects are small categories, the morphisms are <a href="/wiki/functor"><span>functors</span></a>, and the 2-cells are <a href="/wiki/natural-transformation"><span>natural transformations</span></a>.
</span></p><p><span>Obviously here it&#39;s a little silly to use the term &quot;homset,&quot; because we&#39;ve just established that these collections of morphisms are now categories, not sets. The term &quot;homcategory&quot; comes up sometimes, but 2-categories are an example of &quot;higher category,&quot; where you generally advance to the term &quot;hom-object.&quot; A hom-object is an object of some category, so small 1-categories have hom-objects in the category of sets \(\texttt{Set}\), and 2-categories have hom-objects in the category of categories \(\texttt{Cat}\). In higher category theory, we say that a category is &quot;enriched&quot; over the category of its hom-objects, so good ol&#39;-fashioned categories are \(\texttt{Set}\)-enriched, and 2-categories are \(\texttt{Cat}\)-enriched. Notice that \(\texttt{Set}\) is itself \(\texttt{Set}\)-enriched (enriched over itself!) and similarly \(\texttt{Cat}\) is \(\texttt{Cat}\)-enriched. It turns out that self-enrichment is just the same as having <a href="/wiki/exponential-object"><span>exponential objects</span></a>! It&#39;s worth taking a moment to think about why that is, because it&#39;s simple and satisfying.
</span></p><p><span>It&#39;s hopefully obvious that there are also 3-categories, 4-categories, and so on. These have 3-cells, 4-cells, etc. \(\infty\)-categories have no limit to the depth of arrows-between-arrows-between-etc. However, I&#39;m simplifying a lot here and they&#39;re a kind of fuzzy concept, meaning things get very technical and advanced when talking about them. It&#39;s beyond my category-theory level!
</span></p><p><span>Note that the category of 1-categories (which is \(\texttt{Cat}\)) is a 2-category; the category of 2-categories is a 3-category and this pattern continues indefinitely.</span></p></div><div><div style="height:100pt;"></div><p id="copyright-notice" class="subtle-text">© 2024 Ryan Brewer.</p><script src="/__/firebase/8.10.1/firebase-app.js"></script><script src="/__/firebase/8.10.1/firebase-analytics.js"></script><script src="/__/firebase/init.js"></script><script>firebase.analytics();</script></div></div>
