</span></p><p><span>The general idea is that &quot;the selfless are the good&quot; is <i><span>not</span></i> a natural or inherent notion for humans. Nietzsche analyzes morality before Christianity, such as for the ancient Greeks and Romans, and finds a stark difference in attitude to modern Christian/Buddhist morality.
</span></p><p><span>He shows that the free-spirited human was violent to their fellow humans for all sorts of reasons, and was proud of it. These kinds of people were &quot;good&quot; because they were the strongest. Everything they wanted, they took, and they were happy. There&#39;s a degree of idealism here as well, in the fact that if something terrible happened that was outside their control then it was still seen as a <i><span>personal</span></i> failure.
</span></p><p><span>He then goes on to show how the oppressed/weak people (the &quot;bad&quot;) weaponized guilt to redefine morality. They argued that it&#39;s actually the <i><span>weak</span></i> who are good, because they are the ones who are &quot;selfless&quot; and &quot;self-sacrificing&quot;. Their weakness becomes a &quot;choice,&quot; and the strong become &quot;evil&quot; for &quot;choosing&quot; to be the strong.
</span></p><p><span>What is guilt, for Nietzsche? It&#39;s the by-product of civilization forcing humans to direct their violence inwards instead of against others. The desire to inflict suffering can no longer be satisfied once civilization has been established: you are only allowed to inflict suffering on yourself, and, as sick as it is, you still enjoy it.
</span></p><p><span>Nietzsche ultimately writes about all of this because he sees society as extremely sick. He demands <i><span>new</span></i> human values (he has, after all, shown that values can change) so that we can stop attacking happiness and enjoying pain.
</span></p><p><span>At many points throughout the book, Nietzsche refers to the weak as the &quot;Jews.&quot; He even calls them resentful and vindictive. Is this antisemitic? Hitler certainly thought so, citing Nietzsche as a major influence. But the irony here is that the Jews he&#39;s talking about are actually Jesus and his disciples! It&#39;s a criticism of Christianity, not of Judaism. And, importantly, his theory is about &quot;slave morality&quot; in general, so it applies to any oppressed group. And he doesn&#39;t support oppression (the arrest of the strong is a crucial step towards modern civilization!), he just hates the idealization of self-loathing.</span></p></div><div><div style="height:100pt;"></div><p id="copyright-notice" class="subtle-text">© 2024 Ryan Brewer.</p><script src="/__/firebase/8.10.1/firebase-app.js"></script><script src="/__/firebase/8.10.1/firebase-analytics.js"></script><script src="/__/firebase/init.js"></script><script>firebase.analytics();</script></div></div>
