This is useful because it gives a notion of two-argument functor (hence the name).
</span></p><p><span>The definition and laws can be derived from the definition of a functor and a product category, but the main points are that the condition of &quot;functoriality&quot; becomes a condition of &quot;bifunctoriality:&quot; Given two product-category morphisms \(h, k\) and \(f, g\), bifunctoriality of a bifunctor \(F\) states that \(F((h, k)\circ(f, g))=F(h\circ f, k\circ g)\). This really is just functoriality, specialized to the case of a product category in the domain of the functor.
</span></p><p><span>The most important bifunctors to be aware of are those formed by <a href="/wiki/monoidal-category"><span>monoidal products</span></a>. The cartesian product \(A\times B\) gives a bifunctor \(-\times-\) from \(C\times C\) to \(C\) for any cartesian category \(C\). Other monoidal products \(\otimes\) in monoidal categories give bifunctors \(-\otimes-\) from \(C\times C\) to \(C\) for any monoidal category \(C\). This includes the coproduct \(-+-\).
</span></p><p><span>No, the very notion of a product category \(C\times D\) does not give a bifunctor from \(\texttt{Cat}\times\texttt{Cat}\) to <a href="/wiki/cat"><span>\(\texttt{Cat}\)</span></a>, at least not in the way we&#39;ve defined it so far. This is because we&#39;re thinking of functors as arrows in \(\texttt{Cat}\), which doesn&#39;t contain itself, and because we&#39;re thinking of product categories as the cartesian product in \(\texttt{Cat}\), which doesn&#39;t contain itself. So we&#39;d need to lift all of these definitions up a level if we want to talk about \(\texttt{Cat}\times\texttt{Cat}\) as a category, and \(\texttt{Cat}\times\texttt{Cat}\to\texttt{Cat}\) as a functor. However, this lifting is so routine and unproblematic that we generally ignore it, and happily talk about bifunctors from \(\texttt{Cat}\times\texttt{Cat}\) to \(\texttt{Cat}\). 
</span></p><p><span>It may also help to notice that the cartesian products are there already, whether we like them or not, and bifunctors just introduce mappings between them. So there&#39;s nothing wrong with a cartesian product bifunctor, even if cartesian products are used to define bifunctors. The definition of cartesian product doesn&#39;t depend on bifunctors at all, so there&#39;s no circularity.
</span></p><p><span>There are interesting cases where regular category-theoretic morphism composition forms a bifunctor. For example, if you take the <a href="/wiki/homset"><span>homset</span></a> of an object \(A\) to itself in some category \(C\), then you know any two elements in that set can be composed. Furthermore, the composition is associative and has an identity (\(id_A\)). So this set forms a monoid. If we take these morphisms as the objects of a category, then it&#39;s a monoidal category, where composition is the monoidal product. Since it&#39;s a monoidal product, we know there&#39;s a bifunctor \(-\circ-\). This is really a thing for 2-categories, since that&#39;s where the morphisms between objects form categories. (Though I will point out that technically, all 1-categories are at least 2-categories in some way or another, since any set (including homsets) can be used as the objects of a category, perhaps just a discrete one, where the morphisms are set-theoretic equality. It&#39;s just that these situations are boring enough that we ignore them.)</span></p></div><div><div style="height:100pt;"></div><p id="copyright-notice" class="subtle-text">© 2024 Ryan Brewer.</p><script src="/__/firebase/8.10.1/firebase-app.js"></script><script src="/__/firebase/8.10.1/firebase-analytics.js"></script><script src="/__/firebase/init.js"></script><script>firebase.analytics();</script></div></div>
