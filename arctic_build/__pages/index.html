I&#39;m a passionate software developer working on open-source software 
for safe, reliable, and portable applications.
I specialize in a formal methods approach to systems design, with a focus on ergonomics.
In general, my projects aim to be formally memory-safe, fault-tolerant, and very lightweight. 
Via minimality, I hope to make formal theory more accessible outside the ivory tower of academia,
and easier to put into practice where it matters.
One of my bigger projects is <a href="https://arctic-framework.org">Arctic</a>,
A friendly web framework for easily building fast web applications in Gleam!
Arctic powers this website, as well as the one I just linked.
If my projects seem cool or valuable in any way, consider supporting my work!

I use this as a space to store my ideas, advertise myself and my work, and write blog posts about topics that I love.
Generally I constrain my posts to be about programming language theory or implementations. 
Links to my latest posts can be found below. I also have a useful <a href="/wiki">wiki</a> of concepts I&#39;ve studied, expressed accessibly.
A good explanation is the best proof of my own understanding, and an exciting challenge. 
This website is hosted by Firebase and written in <a href="https://gleam.run">Gleam</a>, and the code is up on my <a href="https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/ryanbrewer-dev">github</a>. Instead of a typical web framework, I wrote my own web framework called <a href="https://arctic-framework.org">Arctic</a> on top of the amazing <a href="https://lustre.build/">Lustre</a>. Scripting, markup, styles, etc. for this site are all done by me :)</p><h3 style="padding-top:50pt;">Blog Posts</h3><ul id="posts-list"><li id="par" class="post-thumbnail"><h3><a href="../posts/par">Par Part 3: Par, Continued</a></h3><div class="subtle-text">March 8, 2025</div><p>Par is notoriously difficult to understand, but mostly due to a lack of resources.
