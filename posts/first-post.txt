description: A test post for the blog.

@paragraph@
This is my first blog post! It's mostly to test out the codebase.

This project is using a few neat tools together.
The code for the home page is written in gleam (compiled to javascript).
Blog posts like these are written in text files in a custom format.
A build step uses Lustre and Vite to parse the files, produce html files, and bundle the site for deployment.
All the code can be found on [https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/ryanbrewer-dev](my github).

The styles on this site are a work in progress. `code`, *italics*, \\\*escaping, [https://ryanbrewer.dev](links), \\(math+2^2\\).
