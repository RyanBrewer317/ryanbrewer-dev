blerb: A test post for the blog.

This is my first blog post! It's mostly to test out the codebase.

This project is using a few neat tools together. The code for the home page is written in gleam (compiled to javascript). Blog posts like these are written in text files in a custom format. A build step uses Lustre and Vite to parse the files, produce html files, and bundle the site for deployment. All the code can be found on [my github](https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/ryanbrewer-dev). 

The styles on this site are a work in progress. `code`, *italics*, \\\*escaping, [links](https://ryanbrewer.dev), \\(math+2^2\\).

@math
A^1 math_2 block^3!

@diagram
    D\ar(r,"i") & a\ar(d,"g") \\
    m\ar(u,"s") & r\ar(l,"a")

@code
print("A code block!") 
# language is auto-detected atm.
