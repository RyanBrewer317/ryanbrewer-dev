title: My First Wiki Page
tags: first wiki

This is my first wiki page! It's mostly to test out the codebase.

I'm going to start publishing pages for this wiki that are a bit shorter than my blog posts. This will act as my digital brain, knowledge garden, whatever you call it. I'll also be updating each post a bunch over time, instead of hoping to get it all right when I first publish it.
