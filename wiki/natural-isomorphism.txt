Given two [/wiki/functor](functors) \\(F:C\\to D\\) and \\(G:C\\to D\\), a "natural isomorphism" between them \\(\\alpha: F\\cong G\\) is an isomorphism in the [/wiki/functor-category](functor category) \\([C,D]\\). Then \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are called "naturally isomorphic."

In other words, there are two [/wiki/natural-transformation](natural transformations) \\(\\alpha_\\to: F\\to G\\) and \\(\\alpha_\\leftarrow:G\\to F\\) such that \\(\\alpha_\\to\\circ\\alpha_\\leftarrow=id_G\\) and \\(\\alpha_\\leftarrow\\circ\\alpha_\\to=id_F\\). That is, the natural transformation (either of them, doesn't matter which) is *reversible.* Note that \\(\\circ\\) here is referring to the typical (vertical) composition of a functor category, not horizontal composition.

It's worth considering what this looks like when we write the natural transformations in their "pointwise" form, as \\(\\alpha_{\\to,X}:FX\\to GX\\) and \\(\\alpha_{\\leftarrow,X}:GX\\to FX\\). The equations become \\(\\alpha_{\\to,X}\\circ\\alpha_{\\leftarrow,X}=id_G X\\) and \\(\\alpha_{\\leftarrow,X}\\circ\\alpha_{\\to,X}=id_F X\\). Naturally, natural isomorphisms have a pointwise notation as well: \\(\\alpha_X:FX\\cong GX\\). In all of these cases, the index \\(X\\) refers to objects in the category \\(D\\), the codomain of the functors.
