description: This post discusses the interesting typechecker of SaberVM, which uses a stack-based bytecode language with a powerful type system.

It's been a while since I posted anything, because I've been hard at work on SaberVM's 
[https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/SaberVM](implementation) and a little lambda calculus
[https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/SaberLC](compiler) that targets SaberVM.
I thought I should take the time to discuss one of the interesting aspects of my implementation,
a performant typechecker for SaberVM's type system.
