In this post I'm excited to announce the [https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/SVM](Saber Virtual Machine), or SVM.
It's a project I've been working hard on for the past month,
with fascinating properties and an in-progress MVP implementation that's
coming along well.

SVM is a compiler backend for functional languages.

It takes in CPS code that's been closure-converted and hoisted,
and executes it or AOT compiles it to a native binary.

The goals of the project are safety, expressivity, and portability.
