I'm a passionate software developer working on open-source software 
for safe, reliable, and portable applications.
I specialize in a formal methods approach to systems design, with a focus on ergonomics.
My current biggest project is `),o(t([n("https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/SaberVM")]),t([e("SaberVM")])),e(`,
a lightweight abstract machine for functional languages that aims 
to be formally memory-safe, fault-tolerant, and very small. 
With SaberVM, I'm hoping to broaden accessibility to safe computation, 
both by taking it out of the ivory tower of academia and 
by removing the need for expensive hardware.
Consider supporting my work!
