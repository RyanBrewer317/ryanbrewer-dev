The basic example of this is \(\texttt{Set}\), the category of sets and functions between them. Since the objects are all sets, they don&#39;t form a set, or else it would be &quot;the set of all sets&quot; and thus contain itself, which is not allowed. So we go up a level and say that \(\texttt{Set}\) is a &quot;large category,&quot; which means its objects form a proper class (&quot;the class of all sets&quot;) instead of a set. Then a &quot;small category&quot; is one whose objects form a set. 
</span></p><p><span>The other big important example <a href="/wiki/cat"><span>\(\texttt{Cat}\)</span></a>, which is a large category (&quot;the category of all small categories&quot;) because if it were a small category then it would include itself as an object <i><span>and</span></i> its objects would form a set (by the definition of &quot;small&quot; here), which means that that set would contain itself. Thus the objects of \(\texttt{Cat}\) form a proper class.
</span></p><p><span>Since both \(\texttt{Cat}\) and \(\texttt{Set}\) are large categories, you&#39;ll hopefully notice that large categories are hugely consequential to category theory as a practice. For that reason, we ultimately don&#39;t limit our study to small categories as you might expect when coming from other areas of mathematics. For example, you&#39;ll often see the definition of category as having a &quot;class of objects&quot; instead of a &quot;set of objects,&quot; and these sorts of technical considerations (that other disciplines avoid at all costs) permeating every aspect of category theory as a practice.
</span></p><p><span>We also have a notion of &quot;locally small category&quot; and &quot;locally large category.&quot; &quot;Locally&quot; typically means we&#39;re talking about the <a href="/wiki/homset"><span>homsets</span></a> of a category. So &quot;locally small&quot; means the morphisms from one object to another form a set, and &quot;locally large&quot; means the morphisms from one object to another form a proper class (in which case you might refer to it as a &quot;homclass&quot; or something like that, though at this point you usually take the leap to &quot;hom object&quot;).</span></p></div><div><p class="subtle-text" id="copyright-notice">© 2025 Ryan Brewer.</p><script src="/__/firebase/8.10.1/firebase-app.js"></script><script src="/__/firebase/8.10.1/firebase-analytics.js"></script><script src="/__/firebase/init.js"></script><script>firebase.analytics();</script></div></div></body></html>
