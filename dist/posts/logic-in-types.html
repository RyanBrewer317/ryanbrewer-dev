When I was first introduced to proof assistants like Coq, I thought it would be graduate-level material
that was way beyond what I could ever hope to understand. However, the essence of how they work is surprisingly simple,
and very beautiful. In this post I will explain the intuition behind dependent types and their relationship with proofs,
using a C-like syntax.
</p><p>
A little familiarity with dependent types and proof assistants like Agda or Coq will help you understand this post, but isn&#39;t necessary.
A familiarity with basic logic is assumed, including &quot;for all.&quot;
A familiarity with programming in statically-typed languages like C, Go, OCaml, or TypeScript is assumed.
</p><h4>
Logic in Types
</h4><p>
In academia, there is a well-known correspondence between logic and type systems,
called the Curry-Howard Isomorphism. 
It&#39;s a big name but the idea is simple:
if a type has a value in it,
then it&#39;s &quot;true,&quot; and if it&#39;s empty, it&#39;s &quot;false.&quot; 
So <code>void</code> is false and <code>int</code> is true, for example.
</p><p>
Structs (pairs, tuples, records, etc.) only have values if all the component types have values:
you could never make a struct of type <code>struct{void a, int b}</code> 
because you would need a value of type <code>void</code> to construct it.
This gets us a way to express logical &quot;and:&quot; <code>struct{void a, int b}</code> is &quot;false,&quot; <code>struct{int a, int b}</code> is &quot;true.&quot;
</p><p>
Enums (tagged unions, etc.) have values if any of the component types have values.
For example, <code>enum{void a, int b}</code> has values, namely integers tagged with <code>b</code>.
<code>enum{void a, void b}</code>, on the other hand, is a type with no values, and is therefore &quot;false.&quot;
This gets us a way to express logical &quot;or.&quot;
</p><p>
Functions (pure, side-effect-free ones that is) operate like implication.
if the input type has values, then any value in the function type can be used to construct a value of the output type.
This needs examples.
<code>void-&gt;void</code> is a type with a value, namely <code>(x: void)=&gt;x</code>, so it&#39;s &quot;true&quot; but not very useful.
<code>void-&gt;int</code> is a type with values, such as <code>(x: void)=&gt;7</code>, but also isn&#39;t useful.
You&#39;d need values of type <code>void</code> to be able to call these functions!
<code>int-&gt;int</code> is a familiar type which of course has many values.
<code>int-&gt;void</code> <i>doesn&#39;t</i> have values. Why? Say we had a function <code>f</code> of type <code>int-&gt;void</code>. Then we could call <code>f(5)</code> and get a value of type <code>void</code> back, which is impossible.
So <code>int -&gt; void</code> is a type with no values, because any such values would be able to construct elements of &quot;void.&quot;
Hopefully these examples make it clear why functions work like implication.
</p><p>
Logical negation is simply represented by a function returning <code>void</code>, because
&quot;not p&quot; and &quot;p implies false&quot; are equivalent.
That&#39;s another explanation of why <code>int-&gt;void</code> is empty: it&#39;s kind of like &quot;not <code>int</code>,&quot; and we know <code>int</code> is &quot;true.&quot;
Note that this logic also doesn&#39;t have &quot;p or not p&quot; as an axiom. It is &quot;intuitionistic.&quot;
</p><h4>
The Point
</h4><p>
Is all of this useful? Yes, it&#39;s proven its worth. 
Because the details of this correspondence is about types having values, you can make sure functions are
only called under the right conditions. 
Simply add a parameter to the function in question; a parameter whose type corresponds to the desired precondition. 
Then the function can&#39;t be called unless a value (called a &quot;proof&quot; in this context) of that type is given.
In other words, it can only be called if the type is &quot;true.&quot;
The classic example is something like, for a list of integers, <code>int get(int[] l, int i, 0&lt;=i&lt;length(l) p)</code>.
This function is called with three arguments: an <code>int[]</code>, an <code>int</code>, and a <code>0&lt;=i&lt;length(l)</code>.
</p><p>
The correspondence I described above doesn&#39;t tell you how to construct the type <code>0&lt;=i&lt;length(l).</code>
It&#39;s a very strange-looking type.
At the very least, it&#39;s a struct: the conjunction of two propositions <code>0 &lt;= i</code> and <code>i &lt; length(l)</code>.
This is where dependent types come in.
</p><h4>
Dependent Types
</h4><p>
Dependent function types (&quot;Pi&quot; types) are function types where the type of the output can refer to values of the input types.
What does this mean? 
We can have a function <code>f</code> with a type like <code>(t: type)-&gt;(t-&gt;t)</code>, 
where the output type <i>changes</i> based on what argument the function is called with.
Note that this notation assigns a parameter name to the first parameter type so later types can refer to it.
If <code>f</code> is defined as <code>(t: type)=&gt;(x: t)=&gt;x</code> then <code>f(int)(7)</code> returns <code>7</code>, and <code>f(float)(1.4)</code> returns <code>1.4</code>.
</p><p>
Extending this to the setting of multiple-argument functions, it also means that input types can refer to the given values of earlier parameters.
The <code>get</code> function above has a dependent function type, because the type <code>0&lt;=i&lt;length(l)</code> refers to the earlier parameters <code>i</code> and <code>l</code>.
This type is really <code>struct{0&lt;=i a, i&lt;length(l) b}</code>, since it&#39;s a logical &quot;and.&quot;
The <code>&lt;=</code> and <code>&lt;</code> operators here are definable functions, which take integers as arguments and produce types.
So <code>get</code> can be called only if a struct can be constructed with two fields that respectively satisfy these two inequalities.
</p><p>
Dependent function types have another use here, which is that they&#39;re the main way people represent logic&#39;s &quot;forall&quot; quantifier.
That is, if your proposition is &quot;forall n: int, n &lt; 5 implies n &lt; 6&quot; or something like that, 
you generally use a dependent function type.
The type would be something like <code>(n: int)-&gt;(n &lt; 5)-&gt;(n &lt; 6)</code>. 
This works like &quot;for all&quot; because functions of this type can only be constructed if <i>every possible result type</i> has a value.
In the case of <code>(n: int)-&gt;(n &lt; 5)-&gt;(n &lt; 6)</code>, a value of this type <i>can</i> be created, 
because proving that n is less than 5 is sufficient to prove that it is less than 6.
If the type were instead <code>(n: int)-&gt;(n &gt; 5)-&gt;(n &gt; 6)</code>, and we have a function <code>f</code> of this type,
then it could be called like <code>f(6)(proof_6_gt_5)</code> which are all valid terms, 
and then as a result you&#39;d have a value of type <code>6 &gt; 6</code>, which is &quot;false&quot; and has no values.
Therefore this function <code>f</code> can&#39;t exist, even though calling it with other arguments <i>would</i> hypothetically be valid. 
This is why dependent function types let you express &quot;for all&quot; in your types.
</p><h4>
Tip of the Iceberg
</h4><p>
This concludes my first real blog post. 
Needless to say these ideas are the tip of a very large iceberg.
For example, types like <code>int</code> seem pretty different from useful proposition types like <code>0&lt;=i</code>.
To find out more about that difference, look up <code>Prop</code> and <code>Set</code> in Coq&#39;s type system.
I also didn&#39;t explain &quot;there exists;&quot; 
The search term here is &quot;Sigma&quot; types, which I may write about more in the future.
And there&#39;s still a ways to go before you get a full proof assistant.
I think that this article gives a good foundation for exploring this iceberg on your own,
but it was intended to set up future posts I want to write
about the corners of the iceberg that really fascinate me.
